## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Arriving?

1. **Check Resend Dashboard**

   - Log in to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Go to "Emails" tab
   - Check if email was sent successfully

2. **Check Spam Folder**

   - Resend test domain emails often go to spam
   - Use verified domain for production

3. **Check Backend Logs**

   ```bash
   # Look for errors in terminal running uvicorn
   # Should see:
   INFO:app.core.delivery.service:Sending newsletter <draft_id> to <email>
   INFO:app.core.delivery.service:Newsletter sent successfully: {...}
   ```

4. **Check API Response**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for `/delivery/send` request
   - Check response for errors

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Failed to send newsletter: API key not configured"**

- Solution: Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` is in `.env` file
- Restart backend server after adding

**Issue: "Email not found in authentication"**

- Solution: Make sure user is logged in
- Check that `user?.email` is available in frontend

**Issue: "Images not showing in email"**

- Solution: Make sure item image URLs are publicly accessible
- Check that images are included in draft markdown
