}
```

**✅ Result:** 2/2 sources created successfully

---

## 📥 Step 2: Ingesting Content

**Purpose:** Fetch and parse RSS feeds to extract content items

**Process:**

1. HTTP GET requests to RSS feed URLs
2. Parse XML using `feedparser`
3. Extract title, URL, summary, published date
4. Check for duplicates (by URL)
5. Store in database

**Input:**

- Source IDs: `["a516e5e6-d64c-4d22-b801-b7a44411b02c", "80ed8153-24bc-47fd-8d3d-440b7dc82d6f"]`
- Force refresh: `true`

**Output:**

```json
{
  "processed_sources": 2,
  "new_items": 0,
